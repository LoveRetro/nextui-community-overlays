# NextUI Community Overlays

This repository hosts a collection of community-created emulator overlays for the NextUI custom firmware.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to provide a centralized location for NextUI users to share and download high-quality overlays for their favorite retro gaming systems. By consolidating these resources, we make it easier for the community to customize their experience and for creators to share their work.

## Repository Structure
The directory structure is organized hierarchically to ensure compatibility and ease of navigation:

1. **Libretro Core**: The top level folders correspond to the supported libretro core names (e.g., `MGBA`, `FC`, `SFC`).
2. **Screen Resolution**: Subfolders define the target resolution for the overlay (e.g., `720p`, `768p`).
3. **Author Name**: Inside the resolution folder, each author has their own dedicated folder to keep their work grouped together.

### Example Path
`MGBA/720p/ExampleUser/overlay_design_1.png`

## How to Contribute
Interested community members are welcome to upload their overlays! To contribute:
1. Locate the folder for the **Core** your overlay is designed for.
2. Select the correct **Resolution** folder.
3. Create a new folder with your **Username** or **Author Name**.
4. Add your overlay files to that folder.

These overlays may eventually be included directly with NextUI.

## Licensing
The rights to the overlays hosted in this repository stay with their original creators under their respective licenses. If you are a creator, feel free to include a license file in your folder. If you download or remix anything in this repository, you are expected to respect the licenses and terms set by the original authors.
